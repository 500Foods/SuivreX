# SuirvreX

This repository contains the SuivreX project, a new robotic arm experimental project. 

As an experimental project, it may end up heading in different directions. But the thinking at the outset is that this will involve a C program to talk to a CAN bus network of servo motors. This C program will in turn offer up a WebSocket API that can then be accessed by a JavaScript program to send it commands and receive feedback. The JavaScript program will provide a visual UI of some kind, likely something that eventually gets rendered as WebGL. There will also likely be two robot arms. A mini version that can be used as an input controller (back drivable) and a 10x version that is most definitely not back drivable. May also involve an interface with a controller of some kind, but that will likely come after some kind of inverse kinematics is worked out.

## Key Dependencies - JavaScript interface
As with any modern web application, other JavaScript libraries/dependencies have been used in this project. Most of the time, this is handled via a CDN link (usually JSDelivr) in the Project.html file. In some cases, for performance or other reasons, they may be included directly.
